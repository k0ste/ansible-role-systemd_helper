# ansible-systemd_helper

Allow to define systemd:
* [journald.conf](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html);
* [tmpfiles](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html);
* set timezone via [systemd-timedatectl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/timedatectl.html);
* [timesyncd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-timesyncd.service.html)
support;
* set console settings via [vconsole.conf](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/vconsole.conf.html)
* [networkd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-networkd.html)
support;
* [resolved](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.html)
support;
* [modules-load](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/modules-load.d.html)
support;

## Requirements

* Ansible 2.5+;

## Extra

* journald options is not validate and pass as-is. For all possible options
consult `man journald.conf(5)`;
* tmpfiles are validated by real time execution (online apply settings);
* udev rules syntax validated via external script;
* networkd address declaration may be simpe and complex:
  * simple: is just a one or many addresses and gateway:

  ```yaml
  systemd_networkd:
  - interfaces:
    - interface: 'eth0'
      type: 'ether'
      physaddr: '18:66:da:e6:be:88'
      address: '10.10.10.2/24'
      gateway: '10.10.10.1'
  ```

  * complex: you can declare more `ip` options:

  ```yaml
  systemd_networkd:
  - interfaces:
    - interface: 'eth0'
      type: 'ether'
      physaddr: '18:66:da:e6:be:88'
      ip:
      - address: '10.10.10.2/24'
        gateway: '10.10.10.1'
        preferred_lifetime: 'forever'
        scope: 'global'
  ```
* networkd can use shell-style globs for match devices. For example if your host
just need simple dhcp on ethernet interfaces you can define simple
'match any eth iface' like this:

  ```yaml
    ---
    systemd_networkd:
    - interfaces:
      - interface: 'ethernet'
        type: 'ether'
        dhcp: 'yes'
        match_override:
        - match_entry: 'Name'
          match_value: 'e*' # <--- any linux `ens*/enp*/eth*` device
  ```

    multicast_dns: ''
# Takes a boolean argument or 'allow-downgrade'. If true all DNS lookups are
# DNSSEC-validated locally (excluding LLMNR and Multicast DNS). If the response
# to a lookup request is detected to be invalid a lookup failure is returned to
# applications. Note that this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNSSEC.
# If the DNS server does not properly support DNSSEC all validations will fail.
# If set to "allow-downgrade" DNSSEC validation is attempted, but if the server
# does not support DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC mode is automatically disabled. Note
# that this mode makes DNSSEC validation vulnerable to "downgrade" attacks,
# where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by
# synthesizing a DNS response that suggests DNSSEC was not supported. If set to
# false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated. Note that DNSSEC validation
# requires retrieval of additional DNS data, and thus results in a small DNS
# look-up time penalty. DNSSEC requires knowledge of "trust anchors" to prove
# data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root domain is built into
# the resolver, additional trust anchors may be defined with
# dnssec-trust-anchors.d. Trust anchors may change at regular intervals, and
# old trust anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is not
# possible until new trust anchors are configured locally or the resolver
# software package is updated with the new root trust anchor. In effect, when
# the built-in trust anchor is revoked and 'dnssec' is true, all further
# lookups will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether lookups are
# correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If 'dnssec' is set to
# 'allow-downgrade' the resolver will automatically turn off DNSSEC validation
# in such a case. Client programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether
# lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the returned data could
# not be verified (either because the data was found unsigned in the DNS, or
# the DNS server did not support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were
# known). In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ a
# secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should this be required.
# It is recommended to set 'dnssec' to true on systems where it is known that
# the DNS server supports DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor
# updates happen regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set 'dnssec'
# to 'allow-downgrade'. In addition to this global 'dnssec' setting
# systemd-networkd.service also maintains per-link 'dnssec' settings. For
# system DNS servers (see above), only the global 'dnssec' setting is in effect.
# For per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is
# unset in which case the global setting is used instead. Site-private DNS zones
# generally conflict with 'dnssec' operation, unless a negative (if the private
# zone is not signed) or positive (if the private zone is signed) trust anchor
# is configured for them. If 'allow-downgrade' mode is selected, it is
# attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using top-level domains (TLDs)
# that are not known by the DNS root server. This logic does not work in all
# private zone setups. Defaults to off.
    dnssec: 'false'
# Takes a boolean argument. If 'yes' (the default), resolving a domain name

# particularly high when DNSSEC is used. Note that caching is turned off

# Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception. LLDP is a link-layer
# protocol commonly implemented on professional routers and bridges which
# announces which physical port a system is connected to, as well as other
# related data. Accepts a boolean or the special value 'routers-only'.
# When 'true', incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of all LLDP
# neighbors maintained. If 'routers-only' is set only LLDP data of various
# types of routers is collected and LLDP data about other types of devices
# ignored (such as stations, telephones and others). If 'false', LLDP reception
# is disabled. Defaults to 'routers-only'. LLDP is only available on Ethernet
# links.
    lldp_receive: 'true'
# Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission. Accepts a boolean
# parameter or the special values 'nearest-bridge', 'non-tpmr-bridge' and
# 'customer-bridge'. Defaults to 'false', which turns off LLDP packet emission.
# If not false, a short LLDP packet with information about the local system is
# sent out in regular intervals on the link. The LLDP packet will contain
# information about the local host name, the local machine ID
# (as stored in machine-id(5)) and the local interface name, as well as the
# pretty hostname of the system (as set in machine-info(5)). LLDP emission is
# only available on Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data suitable
# for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on
# untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made
# available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which
# interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values
# control propagation of the LLDP packets. The 'nearest-bridge' setting permits
# propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, 'non-tpmr-bridge' permits
# propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and
# 'customer-bridge' permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached. For
# details about these concepts, see IEEE 802.1AB-2009. Note that configuring
# this setting to 'true' is equivalent to 'nearest-bridge', the recommended and
# most restricted level of propagation.

# The TCP initial congestion window is used during the start of a TCP
